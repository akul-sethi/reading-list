This repo contains a collection of research papers I have read and enjoyed, and my notes on them. They mostly involve computer science, but can be about anything. 

| Paper | Description | Have Read? |
|-------| ------------| -----------|
| [ART: Automatic multi-step reasoning and tool-use for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09014) | A tool based method for code editing |❌|
